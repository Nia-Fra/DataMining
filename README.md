## Overview
ModernDay is a private school seeking to improve its efforts at acquiring new students. The school serves children in preschool through grade 12 and wants to promote its programs to households most likely to enroll. For this study the team utilized the CRISP-DM process for analyzing and modeling the data. Eight different models were run and tested. 

## Approach 
The CRISP-DM or Data Mining Life Cycle process was used to analyze and model the data for this study. First, by identifying the project objectives, examining the data for comprehension, and finally cleaning and wrangling the data for modeling.

To preserve a larger sample size, classification and regression tree approaches were used to fill in the missing data. This appraoch is detailed in the _.pdf_ report.

Following data preparation, I manipulated the data for modeling and evaluation before drawing results and recommendations. The process and results are found in the _Modern Day Enrollment_ pdf report.
